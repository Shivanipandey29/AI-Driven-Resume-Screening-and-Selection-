# AI-Driven-Resume-Screening-and-Selection-

This project is a comprehensive solution for automating the resume screening and candidate selection process using artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques. It aims to streamline the recruitment process by efficiently analyzing resumes, extracting relevant skills, and evaluating candidate suitability based on job requirements.

Features
Automated Resume Analysis
The system allows users to upload resumes in PDF format, which are then automatically analyzed and scored based on the presence of specific skills.
Skill Extraction
Utilizing spaCy, a powerful natural language processing library, the system extracts key skills mentioned in the resume. This ensures that relevant skills are identified accurately, even in unstructured text.
Scoring System
Resumes are assigned scores based on the presence of predefined skills relevant to the job role. The scoring system helps recruiters prioritize candidates based on their skillsets and qualifications.
Job Description Similarity
The system calculates the similarity between a provided job description and the candidate's resume. This metric gives recruiters insights into how well the candidate's skills align with the requirements of the job role.
User Interface
Implemented using Streamlit, a user-friendly web framework for Python, the system features an intuitive interface that allows recruiters to interact with the application seamlessly.
